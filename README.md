a few simple scripts to make completing paid surveys faster

## How to use:
There are two ways to use the scripts:
1. copy-paste the code directly into browser's dev console (the boring way)
2. create bookmarks (`bookmarks` directory) and just click them when needed (the cool kid way)
## Files:
1. `bookmarks` directory - contains ready to use bookmarks. Generated by [Bookmarklet Creator](https://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/)
2. `memorizednames.js` - picks a few random testnames from local storage and puts them in textboxes. 
3. `neutralandno.js` - picks `No`/`Neutral` on two possible pages. Saves a lot of time.
4. `ratings.js` - picks random options on pages with multiple choices (1-10 rates, one of 3 possible pronouncations). Saves a lot of time. Not every option has the same chance to be picked, but it doesn't matter anyway.
5. `similardrugs.js` - opens *testname* + `drug` and *testname* + `medicament` Google searches for each testname. Very useful for finding drugs with similar names. Additionally, saves testnames to local storage for use in `memorizednames.js`.
